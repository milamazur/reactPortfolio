                                    I have always been fascinated by the creative process and the beauty it can bring to the world.
                                    This passion led me to pursue a <strong className="underline text-pink-500">Master of Fine Arts in Easel Painting  and Graphic Design </strong> at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ.
                                    During my studies, I had the opportunity to participate in an exchange program at the Universidad Comlutense de Madrid,
                                    which broadened my perspective and enriched my creative skills.</p>
                                <p className="mb-4">
                                    After completing my Master's degree, I decided to further my education by pursuing a graduate degree in <strong className="underline text-pink-500"> Programming </strong> at Thomas More University in Lier.
                                    I am currently in the process of honing my programming skills and looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead.
                                </p>
                                <p className="mb-4">
                                    My journey in the world of arts and programming has been a blend of creativity, problem-solving,
                                    and continuous learning. Each step has been a stepping stone towards my goal of becoming a well-rounded professional.
